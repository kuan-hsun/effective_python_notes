## 03 The difference between bytes, str, and unicode
'''
There are two types to represent characters in Python 3
1. bytes: made by binary data (8 bit value)
2. str: made by Unicode

Represent Unicode into binary data, we need to encode, like UTF-8:
Unicode -> encode -> Binary
Binary -> decode -> Unicode
